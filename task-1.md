DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and integration between development and operations teams. The goal of DevOps is to increase deployment frequency, achieve faster time to market, and improve the reliability and stability of software systems.
The three most popular tools used in DevOps are:

1. **Jenkins** – An open-source automation server widely used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
2. **Docker** – A platform for containerizing applications, making them portable and consistent across different environments.
3. **Kubernetes** – An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
